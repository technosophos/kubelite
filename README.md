# KubeLite: Minimal Kubernetes API

[![Stability: Unsupported](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/unsupported.svg)](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/unsupported.html)

Perfect for when you need the Kubernetes APIs, but not the rest of Kubernetes.

This package provides the following:

- The v1 API, marhsalable to JSON or YAML
- Marshal and Unmarshal implementations for JSON or YAML

This library can be used to:

- Read or write Kubernetes manifests
- Bundle and unbundle Kubernetes manifests

This library is _not_ intended to...

- Link to (compile into) Kubernetes
- Provide a client
- Provide any of the core services of Kubernetes
- Perform full validation of a manifest. (This provides syntax
  validation only)

## Usage

```
manifests, err := codec.YAML(myBytes).All()

//...

for _, manifest := range manifests {

    // Find out what kind of object it is.
    obj, _ := manifest.Ref()
    println(obj.APIVersion)
    println(obj.Kind)
}

```
